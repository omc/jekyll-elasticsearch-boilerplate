<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h4>SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<i>Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants</i>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech1"><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.1">Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall</a><br>
<a name="1.1.2">And by the doom of death end woes and all.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech2"><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.3">Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.4">I am not partial to infringe our laws:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.5">The enmity and discord which of late</a><br>
<a name="1.1.6">Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</a><br>
<a name="1.1.7">To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.8">Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives</a><br>
<a name="1.1.9">Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.10">Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.11">For, since the mortal and intestine jars</a><br>
<a name="1.1.12">'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.13">It hath in solemn synods been decreed</a><br>
<a name="1.1.14">Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.15">To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.16">If any born at Ephesus be seen</a><br>
<a name="1.1.17">At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.18">Again: if any Syracusian born</a><br>
<a name="1.1.19">Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.20">His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.21">Unless a thousand marks be levied,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.22">To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.23">Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.24">Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.25">Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech3"><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.26">Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.27">My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech4"><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.28">Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</a><br>
<a name="1.1.29">Why thou departed'st from thy native home</a><br>
<a name="1.1.30">And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech5"><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.31">A heavier task could not have been imposed</a><br>
<a name="1.1.32">Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.33">Yet, that the world may witness that my end</a><br>
<a name="1.1.34">Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.35">I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.36">In Syracusa was I born, and wed</a><br>
<a name="1.1.37">Unto a woman, happy but for me,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.38">And by me, had not our hap been bad.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.39">With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</a><br>
<a name="1.1.40">By prosperous voyages I often made</a><br>
<a name="1.1.41">To Epidamnum; till my factor's death</a><br>
<a name="1.1.42">And the great care of goods at random left</a><br>
<a name="1.1.43">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.44">From whom my absence was not six months old</a><br>
<a name="1.1.45">Before herself, almost at fainting under</a><br>
<a name="1.1.46">The pleasing punishment that women bear,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.47">Had made provision for her following me</a><br>
<a name="1.1.48">And soon and safe arrived where I was.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.49">There had she not been long, but she became</a><br>
<a name="1.1.50">A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.51">And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.52">As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.53">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.54">A meaner woman was delivered</a><br>
<a name="1.1.55">Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.56">Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--</a><br>
<a name="1.1.57">I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.58">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.59">Made daily motions for our home return:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.60">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.61">We came aboard.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.62">A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.63">Before the always wind-obeying deep</a><br>
<a name="1.1.64">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.65">But longer did we not retain much hope;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.66">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</a><br>
<a name="1.1.67">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</a><br>
<a name="1.1.68">A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.69">Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.70">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.71">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.72">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.73">That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.74">Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.75">And this it was, for other means was none:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.76">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.77">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.78">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.79">Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.80">Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.81">To him one of the other twins was bound,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.82">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.83">The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.84">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.85">Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.86">And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.87">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.88">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.89">Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.90">And by the benefit of his wished light,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.91">The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</a><br>
<a name="1.1.92">Two ships from far making amain to us,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.93">Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.94">But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!</a><br>
<a name="1.1.95">Gather the sequel by that went before.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech6"><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.96">Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.97">For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech7"><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.98">O, had the gods done so, I had not now</a><br>
<a name="1.1.99">Worthily term'd them merciless to us!</a><br>
<a name="1.1.100">For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.101">We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.102">Which being violently borne upon,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.103">Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.104">So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.105">Fortune had left to both of us alike</a><br>
<a name="1.1.106">What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.107">Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</a><br>
<a name="1.1.108">With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.109">Was carried with more speed before the wind;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.110">And in our sight they three were taken up</a><br>
<a name="1.1.111">By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.112">At length, another ship had seized on us;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.113">And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.114">Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.115">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.116">Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.117">And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.118">Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.119">That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.120">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech8"><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.121">And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.122">Do me the favour to dilate at full</a><br>
<a name="1.1.123">What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech9"><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.124">My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.125">At eighteen years became inquisitive</a><br>
<a name="1.1.126">After his brother: and importuned me</a><br>
<a name="1.1.127">That his attendant--so his case was like,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.128">Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--</a><br>
<a name="1.1.129">Might bear him company in the quest of him:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.130">Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.131">I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.132">Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.133">Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.134">And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.135">Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</a><br>
<a name="1.1.136">Or that or any place that harbours men.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.137">But here must end the story of my life;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.138">And happy were I in my timely death,</a><br>
