<a name="0.1.2">A pair of stocks, you rogue!</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech3"><b>SLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.3">Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in</a><br>
<a name="0.1.4">the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.5">Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!</a><br>

</blockquote>

<a name="speech5"><b>SLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.7">No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold</a><br>
<a name="0.1.8">bed, and warm thee.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="0.1.13">and kindly.</a><br>
<p><i>Falls asleep</i></p>
<p><i>Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train</i></p>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech8"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.14">Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.15">Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.16">And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.17">Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</a><br>
<a name="0.1.18">At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?</a><br>
<a name="0.1.19">I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech9"><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.20">Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.21">He cried upon it at the merest loss</a><br>
<a name="0.1.22">And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.23">Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech10"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.24">Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.25">I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.26">But sup them well and look unto them all:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.27">To-morrow I intend to hunt again.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech11"><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.28">I will, my lord.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech12"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.29">What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech13"><b>Second Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.30">He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.31">This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech14"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.32">O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!</a><br>
<a name="0.1.33">Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</a><br>
<a name="0.1.34">Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.35">What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.36">Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.37">A most delicious banquet by his bed,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.38">And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.39">Would not the beggar then forget himself?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech15"><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.40">Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech16"><b>Second Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.41">It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech17"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.42">Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.43">Then take him up and manage well the jest:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.44">Carry him gently to my fairest chamber</a><br>
<a name="0.1.45">And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.46">Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters</a><br>
<a name="0.1.47">And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.48">Procure me music ready when he wakes,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.49">To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.50">And if he chance to speak, be ready straight</a><br>
<a name="0.1.51">And with a low submissive reverence</a><br>
<a name="0.1.52">Say 'What is it your honour will command?'</a><br>
<a name="0.1.53">Let one attend him with a silver basin</a><br>
<a name="0.1.54">Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.55">Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.56">And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'</a><br>
<a name="0.1.57">Some one be ready with a costly suit</a><br>
<a name="0.1.58">And ask him what apparel he will wear;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.59">Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.60">And that his lady mourns at his disease:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.61">Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.62">And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.63">For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.64">This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.65">It will be pastime passing excellent,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.66">If it be husbanded with modesty.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech18"><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.67">My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.68">As he shall think by our true diligence</a><br>
<a name="0.1.69">He is no less than what we say he is.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech19"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.70">Take him up gently and to bed with him;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.71">And each one to his office when he wakes.</a><br>
<p><i>Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds</i></p>
<a name="0.1.72">Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:</a><br>
<p><i>Exit Servingman</i></p>
<a name="0.1.73">Belike, some noble gentleman that means,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.74">Travelling some journey, to repose him here.</a><br>
<p><i>Re-enter Servingman</i></p>
<a name="0.1.75">How now! who is it?</a><br>

<a name="0.1.77">That offer service to your lordship.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.78">Bid them come near.</a><br>
<p><i>Enter Players</i></p>
<a name="0.1.79">Now, fellows, you are welcome.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech22"><b>Players</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.80">We thank your honour.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech23"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.81">Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech24"><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.82">So please your lordship to accept our duty.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech25"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.83">With all my heart. This fellow I remember,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.84">Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.85">'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.86">I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part</a><br>
<a name="0.1.87">Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech26"><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.88">I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech27"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.89">'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.90">Well, you are come to me in a happy time;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.91">The rather for I have some sport in hand</a><br>
<a name="0.1.92">Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.93">There is a lord will hear you play to-night:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.94">But I am doubtful of your modesties;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.95">Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--</a><br>
<a name="0.1.96">For yet his honour never heard a play--</a><br>
<a name="0.1.97">You break into some merry passion</a><br>
<a name="0.1.98">And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.99">If you should smile he grows impatient.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech28"><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.100">Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.101">Were he the veriest antic in the world.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech29"><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.1.102">Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.103">And give them friendly welcome every one:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.104">Let them want nothing that my house affords.</a><br>
<p><i>Exit one with the Players</i></p>
<a name="0.1.105">Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.106">And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.107">That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;</a><br>
<a name="0.1.108">And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.109">Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.110">He bear himself with honourable action,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.111">Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</a><br>
<a name="0.1.112">Unto their lords, by them accomplished:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.113">Such duty to the drunkard let him do</a><br>
<a name="0.1.114">With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.115">And say 'What is't your honour will command,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.116">Wherein your lady and your humble wife</a><br>
<a name="0.1.117">May show her duty and make known her love?'</a><br>
<a name="0.1.118">And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.119">And with declining head into his bosom,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.120">Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd</a><br>
<a name="0.1.121">To see her noble lord restored to health,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.122">Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him</a><br>
<a name="0.1.123">No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.124">And if the boy have not a woman's gift</a><br>
<a name="0.1.125">To rain a shower of commanded tears,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.126">An onion will do well for such a shift,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.127">Which in a napkin being close convey'd</a><br>
<a name="0.1.128">Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.129">See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.130">Anon I'll give thee more instructions.</a><br>
<p><i>Exit a Servingman</i></p>
<a name="0.1.131">I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.132">Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:</a><br>
<a name="0.1.133">I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</a><br>
<a name="0.1.134">And how my men will stay themselves from laughter</a><br>
<a name="0.1.135">When they do homage to this simple peasant.</a><br>
<a name="0.1.136">I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence</a><br>
<a name="0.1.137">May well abate the over-merry spleen</a><br>
<a name="0.1.138">Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</a><br>

<a name="5.2.170">And not obedient to his honest will,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.171">What is she but a foul contending rebel</a><br>
<a name="5.2.172">And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</a><br>
<a name="5.2.173">I am ashamed that women are so simple</a><br>

<a name="5.2.175">Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.176">When they are bound to serve, love and obey.</a><br>
<a name="5.2.177">Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.178">Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.179">But that our soft conditions and our hearts</a><br>
<a name="5.2.180">Should well agree with our external parts?</a><br>
<a name="5.2.181">Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</a><br>
<a name="5.2.182">My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.183">My heart as great, my reason haply more,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.184">To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</a><br>
<a name="5.2.185">But now I see our lances are but straws,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.186">Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.187">That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</a><br>
<a name="5.2.188">Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.189">And place your hands below your husband's foot:</a><br>
<a name="5.2.190">In token of which duty, if he please,</a><br>
<a name="5.2.191">My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</a><br>
