<a name="1.0.23">So buxom, blithe, and full of face,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.24">As heaven had lent her all his grace;</a><br>
<a name="1.0.25">With whom the father liking took,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.26">And her to incest did provoke:</a><br>
<a name="1.0.27">Bad child; worse father! to entice his own</a><br>
<a name="1.0.28">To evil should be done by none:</a><br>
<a name="1.0.29">But custom what they did begin</a><br>
<a name="1.0.30">Was with long use account no sin.</a><br>
<a name="1.0.31">The beauty of this sinful dame</a><br>
<a name="1.0.32">Made many princes thither frame,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.33">To seek her as a bed-fellow,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.34">In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:</a><br>
<a name="1.0.35">Which to prevent he made a law,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.36">To keep her still, and men in awe,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.37">That whoso ask'd her for his wife,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.38">His riddle told not, lost his life:</a><br>
<a name="1.0.39">So for her many a wight did die,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.40">As yon grim looks do testify.</a><br>
<a name="1.0.41">What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</a><br>
<a name="1.0.42">I give, my cause who best can justify.</a><br>
