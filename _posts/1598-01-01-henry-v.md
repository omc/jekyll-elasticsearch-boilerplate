<a name="1.0.1">O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend</a><br>
<a name="1.0.2">The brightest heaven of invention,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.3">A kingdom for a stage, princes to act</a><br>
<a name="1.0.4">And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</a><br>
<a name="1.0.5">Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.6">Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.7">Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire</a><br>
<a name="1.0.8">Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.9">The flat unraised spirits that have dared</a><br>
<a name="1.0.10">On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</a><br>
<a name="1.0.11">So great an object: can this cockpit hold</a><br>
<a name="1.0.12">The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</a><br>
<a name="1.0.13">Within this wooden O the very casques</a><br>
<a name="1.0.14">That did affright the air at Agincourt?</a><br>
<a name="1.0.15">O, pardon! since a crooked figure may</a><br>
<a name="1.0.16">Attest in little place a million;</a><br>
<a name="1.0.17">And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,</a><br>

<a name="1.0.21">Whose high upreared and abutting fronts</a><br>
<a name="1.0.22">The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:</a><br>

<a name="1.0.25">And make imaginary puissance;</a><br>
<a name="1.0.26">Think when we talk of horses, that you see them</a><br>
<a name="1.0.27">Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;</a><br>
<a name="1.0.28">For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.29">Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.2">Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign</a><br>
<a name="1.1.3">Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.7">It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.8">We lose the better half of our possession:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.9">For all the temporal lands which men devout</a><br>
<a name="1.1.10">By testament have given to the church</a><br>

<a name="1.1.18">And to the coffers of the king beside,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.19">A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.</a><br>

<a name="1.1.27">But that his wildness, mortified in him,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.28">Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment</a><br>
<a name="1.1.29">Consideration, like an angel, came</a><br>
<a name="1.1.30">And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.31">Leaving his body as a paradise,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.32">To envelop and contain celestial spirits.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.33">Never was such a sudden scholar made;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.34">Never came reformation in a flood,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.35">With such a heady currance, scouring faults</a><br>
<a name="1.1.36">Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness</a><br>
<a name="1.1.37">So soon did lose his seat and all at once</a><br>

<a name="1.1.41">And all-admiring with an inward wish</a><br>
<a name="1.1.42">You would desire the king were made a prelate:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.43">Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.44">You would say it hath been all in all his study:</a><br>

<a name="1.1.50">The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.51">And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.52">To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.53">So that the art and practic part of life</a><br>
<a name="1.1.54">Must be the mistress to this theoric:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.55">Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.56">Since his addiction was to courses vain,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.57">His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.58">His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.59">And never noted in him any study,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.60">Any retirement, any sequestration</a><br>
<a name="1.1.61">From open haunts and popularity.</a><br>

<a name="1.1.63">And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</a><br>
<a name="1.1.64">Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.65">And so the prince obscured his contemplation</a><br>
<a name="1.1.66">Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.67">Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.68">Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech13"><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.69">It must be so; for miracles are ceased;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.70">And therefore we must needs admit the means</a><br>
<a name="1.1.71">How things are perfected.</a><br>

<a name="1.1.74">Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty</a><br>
<a name="1.1.75">Incline to it, or no?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech15"><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.76">He seems indifferent,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.77">Or rather swaying more upon our part</a><br>
<a name="1.1.78">Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.79">For I have made an offer to his majesty,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.80">Upon our spiritual convocation</a><br>
<a name="1.1.81">And in regard of causes now in hand,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.82">Which I have open'd to his grace at large,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.83">As touching France, to give a greater sum</a><br>
<a name="1.1.84">Than ever at one time the clergy yet</a><br>
<a name="1.1.85">Did to his predecessors part withal.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="1.1.87">With good acceptance of his majesty;</a><br>

<a name="1.2.12">And justly and religiously unfold</a><br>

<a name="1.2.35">Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.36">That owe yourselves, your lives and services</a><br>
<a name="1.2.37">To this imperial throne. There is no bar</a><br>
<a name="1.2.38">To make against your highness' claim to France</a><br>
<a name="1.2.39">But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.40">'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</a><br>
<a name="1.2.41">'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</a><br>
<a name="1.2.42">Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</a><br>
<a name="1.2.43">To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</a><br>
<a name="1.2.44">The founder of this law and female bar.</a><br>
<a name="1.2.45">Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</a><br>
<a name="1.2.46">That the land Salique is in Germany,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.47">Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</a><br>
<a name="1.2.48">Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.49">There left behind and settled certain French;</a><br>
<a name="1.2.50">Who, holding in disdain the German women</a><br>
<a name="1.2.51">For some dishonest manners of their life,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.52">Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</a><br>
<a name="1.2.53">Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</a><br>
<a name="1.2.54">Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.55">Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</a><br>
<a name="1.2.56">Then doth it well appear that Salique law</a><br>
<a name="1.2.57">Was not devised for the realm of France:</a><br>
<a name="1.2.58">Nor did the French possess the Salique land</a><br>
<a name="1.2.59">Until four hundred one and twenty years</a><br>
<a name="1.2.60">After defunction of King Pharamond,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.61">Idly supposed the founder of this law;</a><br>
<a name="1.2.62">Who died within the year of our redemption</a><br>
<a name="1.2.63">Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</a><br>
<a name="1.2.64">Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</a><br>
<a name="1.2.65">Beyond the river Sala, in the year</a><br>
<a name="1.2.66">Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.67">King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.68">Did, as heir general, being descended</a><br>
<a name="1.2.69">Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.70">Make claim and title to the crown of France.</a><br>
<a name="1.2.71">Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</a><br>
<a name="1.2.72">Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</a><br>
<a name="1.2.73">Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.74">To find his title with some shows of truth,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.75">'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.76">Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.77">Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</a><br>
<a name="1.2.78">To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</a><br>
<a name="1.2.79">Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.80">Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.81">Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.82">Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</a><br>
<a name="1.2.83">That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.84">Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.85">Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</a><br>
<a name="1.2.86">By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</a><br>
<a name="1.2.87">Was re-united to the crown of France.</a><br>
<a name="1.2.88">So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</a><br>
<a name="1.2.89">King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.90">King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</a><br>
<a name="1.2.91">To hold in right and title of the female:</a><br>
<a name="1.2.92">So do the kings of France unto this day;</a><br>
<a name="1.2.93">Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</a><br>
<a name="1.2.94">To bar your highness claiming from the female,</a><br>
<a name="1.2.95">And rather choose to hide them in a net</a><br>
<a name="1.2.96">Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</a><br>
<a name="1.2.97">Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.</a><br>

<a name="3.2.44">fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</a><br>
