<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</h3>
<p></p><blockquote>
<i>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</i>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech1"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.1">Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</a><br>
<a name="1.1.2">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</a><br>
<a name="1.1.3">As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech2"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.4">'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.5">If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech3"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.6">Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech4"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.7">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.8">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.9">Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.10">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.11">But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.12">Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</a><br>
<a name="1.1.13">Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.14">And, in conclusion,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.15">Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.16">'I have already chose my officer.'</a><br>
<a name="1.1.17">And what was he?</a><br>
<a name="1.1.18">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.19">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.20">A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.21">That never set a squadron in the field,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.22">Nor the division of a battle knows</a><br>
<a name="1.1.23">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.24">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</a><br>
<a name="1.1.25">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.26">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.27">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</a><br>
<a name="1.1.28">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</a><br>
<a name="1.1.29">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</a><br>
<a name="1.1.30">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.31">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.32">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech5"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.33">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech6"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.34">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.35">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.36">And not by old gradation, where each second</a><br>
<a name="1.1.37">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.38">Whether I in any just term am affined</a><br>
<a name="1.1.39">To love the Moor.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech7"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.40">I would not follow him then.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech8"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.41">O, sir, content you;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.42">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.43">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</a><br>
<a name="1.1.44">Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</a><br>
<a name="1.1.45">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.46">That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.47">Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.48">For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.49">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</a><br>
<a name="1.1.50">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.51">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.52">And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.53">Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</a><br>
<a name="1.1.54">their coats</a><br>
<a name="1.1.55">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.56">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.57">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.58">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.59">In following him, I follow but myself;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.60">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.61">But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.62">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</a><br>
<a name="1.1.63">The native act and figure of my heart</a><br>
<a name="1.1.64">In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</a><br>
<a name="1.1.65">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</a><br>
<a name="1.1.66">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech9"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.67">What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</a><br>
<a name="1.1.68">If he can carry't thus!</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech10"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.69">Call up her father,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.70">Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.71">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.72">And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.73">Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.74">Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.75">As it may lose some colour.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech11"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.76">Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech12"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.77">Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</a><br>
<a name="1.1.78">As when, by night and negligence, the fire</a><br>
<a name="1.1.79">Is spied in populous cities.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech13"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.80">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech14"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.81">Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</a><br>
<a name="1.1.82">Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</a><br>
<a name="1.1.83">Thieves! thieves!</a><br>
<p><i>BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</i></p>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech15"><b>BRABANTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.84">What is the reason of this terrible summons?</a><br>
<a name="1.1.85">What is the matter there?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech16"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.86">Signior, is all your family within?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech17"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.87">Are your doors lock'd?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech18"><b>BRABANTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.88">Why, wherefore ask you this?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech19"><b>IAGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.89">'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on</a><br>
<a name="1.1.90">your gown;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.91">Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.92">Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</a><br>
<a name="1.1.93">Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.94">Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.95">Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.96">Arise, I say.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech20"><b>BRABANTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.97">                  What, have you lost your wits?</a><br>

</blockquote>

<a name="speech22"><b>BRABANTIO</b></a>

<a name="1.1.99">Not I	what are you?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech23"><b>RODERIGO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.100">My name is Roderigo.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech24"><b>BRABANTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.101">The worser welcome:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.102">I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.103">In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</a><br>
<a name="1.1.104">My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.105">Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.106">Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</a><br>
<a name="1.1.107">To start my quiet.</a><br>

<a name="1.1.109">                  But thou must needs be sure</a><br>
<a name="1.1.110">My spirit and my place have in them power</a><br>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.117">'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</a><br>
<a name="1.1.118">serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</a><br>

<a name="1.1.132">At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.133">Transported, with no worse nor better guard</a><br>
<a name="1.1.134">But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.135">To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--</a><br>
<a name="1.1.136">If this be known to you and your allowance,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.140">That, from the sense of all civility,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.142">Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.143">I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.144">Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</a><br>
<a name="1.1.145">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</a><br>
<a name="1.1.146">Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</a><br>

<a name="1.1.151">Give me a taper! call up all my people!</a><br>
<a name="1.1.152">This accident is not unlike my dream:</a><br>

<p><i>Exit above</i></p>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech38"><b>IAGO</b></a>

<a name="1.1.157">To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--</a><br>
<a name="1.1.158">Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.159">However this may gall him with some cheque,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.160">Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd</a><br>
<a name="1.1.161">With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.162">Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.165">Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.166">Yet, for necessity of present life,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.167">I must show out a flag and sign of love,</a><br>
