<i>Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues</i>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech1"><b>RUMOUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="0.0.1">Open your ears; for which of you will stop</a><br>
<a name="0.0.2">The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?</a><br>
<a name="0.0.3">I, from the orient to the drooping west,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.4">Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</a><br>
<a name="0.0.5">The acts commenced on this ball of earth:</a><br>
<a name="0.0.6">Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.7">The which in every language I pronounce,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.8">Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</a><br>
<a name="0.0.9">I speak of peace, while covert enmity</a><br>
<a name="0.0.10">Under the smile of safety wounds the world:</a><br>
<a name="0.0.11">And who but Rumour, who but only I,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.12">Make fearful musters and prepared defence,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.13">Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.14">Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.15">And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe</a><br>
<a name="0.0.16">Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures</a><br>
<a name="0.0.17">And of so easy and so plain a stop</a><br>
<a name="0.0.18">That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.19">The still-discordant wavering multitude,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.20">Can play upon it. But what need I thus</a><br>
<a name="0.0.21">My well-known body to anatomize</a><br>
<a name="0.0.22">Among my household? Why is Rumour here?</a><br>
<a name="0.0.23">I run before King Harry's victory;</a><br>
<a name="0.0.24">Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</a><br>
<a name="0.0.25">Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.26">Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</a><br>
<a name="0.0.27">Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I</a><br>
<a name="0.0.28">To speak so true at first? my office is</a><br>
<a name="0.0.29">To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</a><br>
<a name="0.0.30">Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.31">And that the king before the Douglas' rage</a><br>
<a name="0.0.32">Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.</a><br>
<a name="0.0.33">This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns</a><br>
<a name="0.0.34">Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</a><br>
<a name="0.0.35">And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.36">Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.37">Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,</a><br>
<a name="0.0.38">And not a man of them brings other news</a><br>
<a name="0.0.39">Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues</a><br>
<a name="0.0.40">They bring smooth comforts false, worse than</a><br>
<a name="0.0.41">true wrongs.</a><br>

<a name="1.1.21">Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</a><br>
<a name="1.1.22">Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John</a><br>
<a name="1.1.23">And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.24">And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.43">A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.44">That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.45">He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him</a><br>
<a name="1.1.46">I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.47">He told me that rebellion had bad luck</a><br>
<a name="1.1.48">And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.49">With that, he gave his able horse the head,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.50">And bending forward struck his armed heels</a><br>
<a name="1.1.51">Against the panting sides of his poor jade</a><br>
<a name="1.1.52">Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</a><br>

<a name="1.1.126">From the best temper'd courage in his troops;</a><br>

<a name="5.5.118">known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here</a><br>
<a name="5.5.119">in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your</a><br>
<a name="5.5.120">patience for it and to promise you a better. I</a><br>
<a name="5.5.121">meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an</a><br>
<a name="5.5.122">ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and</a><br>
<a name="5.5.123">you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you</a><br>
<a name="5.5.124">I would be and here I commit my body to your</a><br>
<a name="5.5.125">mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,</a><br>
<a name="5.5.126">as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.</a><br>
<a name="5.5.127">If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will</a><br>
<a name="5.5.128">you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but</a><br>
<a name="5.5.129">light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a</a><br>
<a name="5.5.130">good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,</a><br>
<a name="5.5.131">and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have</a><br>
<a name="5.5.132">forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the</a><br>
<a name="5.5.133">gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which</a><br>
<a name="5.5.134">was never seen before in such an assembly.</a><br>
<a name="5.5.135">One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too</a><br>
<a name="5.5.136">much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will</a><br>
<a name="5.5.137">continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make</a><br>
<a name="5.5.138">you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for</a><br>
<a name="5.5.139">any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,</a><br>
<a name="5.5.140">unless already a' be killed with your hard</a><br>
<a name="5.5.141">opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is</a><br>
<a name="5.5.142">not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are</a><br>
<a name="5.5.143">too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down</a><br>
<a name="5.5.144">before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</a><br>
